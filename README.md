# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Using your knowledge of PySpark, Pandas, or SQL, youâ€™ll determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. For this analysis, you'll determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

### Overview:
To proceed with this project, I picked a data set from the Amazon RDS with reviews on US Apparel. Using Pyspark to perform the ETL process by extracting the data - I continued my analysis unsing Google colab to continue the anaylsis and determine if there is existing bias in the reviews provided by Vine Members in the data set.

------------------------------------------

### Number of 5 Star and Non-5 Star vine reviews?

In the data set their was a total of 23,748 5-star reviews
21,673 of the 5-star reviews were non-vine

### The % of 5 star & non-5 star reviews?

52.2% of the five_star reviews were vine
52.9 % of the five_star reviews were non-vine


### Summary
The % distribution between the paid and non-paid Vine review members is significantly close. Though, my analysis shows that the 52.2 of the mojority reviewers were vine members and 52.9 percent represents non-vine members. The lack of discrepency tells me that there's no bias with the vine review program.
